I am guilty of spending way too much time on typing games, so this was something I really wanted to try building on my own. 

I am heavily inspired by Key Hero, which is one of my favorite typing tests/game, so check them out here

To run the game on your machine:
- make sure you have node.js installed
- clone the repo
- move into the directory
- npm start
