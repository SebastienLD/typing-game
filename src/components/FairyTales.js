    {name: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, by Brothers Grimm",text: "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window, which had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts. While she was thus engaged and looking out at the snow she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. Now the red looked so well upon the white that she thought to herself, \"Oh, that I had a child as white as this now, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of this frame!\" Soon afterwards a little duaghter came to her, who was as white as snow, and with cheeks as red as blood, and with hair as black as ebony, and from this she was named \"Snow-White.\" And at the same time her mother died"},
    {name: "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids, by Brothers Grimm", text: "There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said: 'Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all-skin, hair, and everything. The wrtetch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.' The kids said: 'Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.' Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind. It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door"}, 
    {name: "The Elves and the Shoemaker, by Brothers Grimm", text: "There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himeself down to his work; when to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening."}, 
    {name: "The Little Mermaid, by Hans Christian Anderson", text: "Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could sound it, and many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed, for on this sand grow the strangest flowers and plants, the leaves and stems of which are so pilant that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, not large and small, glide between the branches as birds fly among the trees here upon land."},
    {name: "The Twelve Dancing Princesses, by Brothers Grimm", text: "There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been. Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any per son could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. A king's son soon came. He was well entertained."},
